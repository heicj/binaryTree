# binaryTree

This was created just to show how binary trees can make searching data more efficient.

This binary tree sorts words alphabetically. Use insert method to add word to tree. Tree also contains a get function to check if word exists in text and the word count. 

index.html page uses a form to interact with the binary tree.  The text area allows input of text to search.  Word input section is used to pick word to search for.

When search button is pressed the text is used to create a binary tree.  The tree is then search to find word provided.  The result is displayed showing the count of the word (which the tree tracks when it is built) and how many nodes it visited to find the node, if it exists. 

Tree returns -1 if word is not in the tree.
